# Installation

## Clone and Install

Please be sure to check what the latest available stable version tag is.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1Ayush-Petwal/Education-Agent.git
```

### Enter directory

```bash
cd eliza
```

### Install dependencies (on initial run)

```bash
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

By default, the pnpm lockfile will not be updated during installations based off of `.npmrc` frozen-lockfile=true. To update the lockfile, you need to run the command:

```bash
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

Please only use this command when you are initially instantiating the repo or are bumping the version of a package or adding a new package to your `package.json`. This practice helps maintain consistency in your project's dependencies and prevents unintended changes to the lockfile.

### Build the local libraries

```bash
pnpm build
```
Run the command recursively till all the build is completed, fix slight errors that might occur system to system

## Configure Environment

### Copy example environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Add the Education agent character

```bash
cd agent/src
touch defualtCharacter.ts
```
Then add this into the Character file:

```bash
import { Character, ModelProviderName } from "@elizaos/core";
import { evmPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-evm";
import { nftGenerationPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-nft-generation";
import { obsidianPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-obsidian";
import { createCredential } from "@elizaos/plugin-evm";

## Interact with the Agent

Now you're ready to start a conversation with your agent! Open a new terminal window and run:

Firstly, To start the agent 
```bash
pnpm start
```
There may arise an error in the agent/src/index.ts file just rewrite the error creating file, no need of anything else

Then on a new terminal run the client that will be interacting with this agent

```bash
pnpm start:client
```

Once the client is running, you'll see a message like this:

```
âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

Simply click the link or open your browser to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/). You'll see the chat interface connect to the system, and you can begin interacting with your character.
